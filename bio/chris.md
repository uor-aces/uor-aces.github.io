### Biography

I completed a PhD in Quantum Field theory at Edinburgh University
in 1998. I used a Cray T3D (and later T3E) to calculate the spectra
and decays of heavy mesons.  Between 1999 and 2005 I continued this
research first as a PPARC personal fellow then as a common or garden
PDRA. By this time I reasised it was perhaps the mathematics and
computation that I wished to persue and I joined the Edinburgh
parallel computing centre (EPCC) <epcc.ed.ac.uk>. Here I ported,
optimised and developed scientific and commercial code for High
Performance Computers (HPC), engaged into research for methods
exploiting such machines and taught aspects of HPC to students on the
MSc course.  In 2012 I left EPCC and joined the Met Office as a <a
href="http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/people/christopher-maynard">scientific
software engineer</a>.  Where I applied what I had learnt to
developing the Unified Model and later designing and developing <a
href="https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/modelling-systems/lfric">LFRic,
a new atmospheric model</a>. I now work part-time for the Met Office
and part-time for the Univeristy of Reading.

### Teaching

Yes, soon (-er than I might hope).
