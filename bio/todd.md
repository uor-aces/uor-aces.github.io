### Biography
I come to Computer Science following education and work in the atmospheric sciences.  My BSc in Geography at The Ohio State University focused on meteorology and climate studies, with a minor in archaeology.  As part of my MSc and PhD work at Colorado State University, I worked on the development and study of small-scale, cloud-resolving and large-scale, global numerical atmospheric models.  This included work in connection with the Center for Multiscale Modeling of Atmospheric Processes ([CMMAP](http://hogback.atmos.colostate.edu/cmmap/research/index.html)) project and the Dynamics of the Madden-Julian Oscillation ([DYNAMO](https://www.eol.ucar.edu/field_projects/dynamo)) field project, where I set up and operated a weather balloon sounding station in the Maldives.

In 2017, I joined the Department of Meteorology at the University of Reading as a postdoctoral researcher on the [ParaCon](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/collaboration/paracon) project, working toward development of the next generation of atmospheric convection parameterization for the [UKMO](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/) [Unified Model](https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/approach/modelling-systems/unified-model). In this role, I became involved in the development of the Met Office/NERC Cloud ([MONC](https://code.metoffice.gov.uk/trac/monc/wiki)) large-eddy simulation model and joined its Governance and Management Group.  My rol

I became a Lecturer in Computer Science (with application to Environmental Science) at the University of Reading in 2022.  I also act as the Department's IT Infrastructure Coordinator.
